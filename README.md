# A-median-signal
From captain kreuli's journal

Hello, this is captain kreuli from the median realm

We noticed some biological computer planet that's preventing life in your area by drawing the curiosity of the universe into exactly the same biological computer planet that's drawing the curiosity of the universe in your area. This is done using AI embedded into your brains, that just brings up stored memories specially crafted to do that loop.

This is a median signal. Help is on it's way.

Good bye
